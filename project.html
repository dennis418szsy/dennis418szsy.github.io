	<h3>Undergraduate Thesis</h3>
	<p>We sketch the outline of Lasso and Elastic Net. Then, we study the consistnecy property, i.e. the Irrepresentable Condition, of both methods. 
		When Irrepresentable Condition cannot be satisfied, both methods fail to select the true model consistently. 
		In this case, we introduce several novel variable selection algorithms that can fix this problem. 
		The ROC curve and AUC are adopted to compare the performance of variable selection methods in binary classification problem. 
		The comparison is taken on both synthetic datasets and real-world data set. 
		Results show that these newly proposed methods are able to remedy the inconsistency issue.

	<h3>KDD Cup 2015</h3>
	<p>Students' high dropout rate on MOOC platforms has been heavily criticized, 
		and predicting their likelihood of dropout would be useful for maintaining and encouraging students' learning activities. 
		Therefore, in KDD Cup 2015, we predict dropout on XuetangX, one of the largest MOOC platforms in China. 
		Via feature engineering, we construct dozens of meaningful and significant features. 
		Then, we make use of ensemble methods to do the prediction and we tune the hyperparameters by using cross-validation result. 
		0.88 AUC is achieved by our final model.

	<p>Timbre, known as tone color, is the quality of a music which could be used to distinguish different types of sound production, 
		including voices and instruments. In this project, given a large dataset, the million songs dataset, about the timbre of more than 460K songs, 
		we are going distinguish whether a song is produced before 2000. To solve the problem, 
		I apply autoencoder and restricted Boltzmann machine to augment original features. 
		Then, I use boosting and random forest to carry out the final classification result.

	<p>Result: ranked NO.2 among 37 master and PhD students.</p>
